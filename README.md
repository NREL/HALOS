# HALOS - Heliostat Aimpoint and Layout Optimization Software 

## Introduction
HALOS is an open-source software decision tool implemented in Python that uses mixed-integer programming models to determine the best aimpoint strategy for the solar collection field of a concentrating solar power (CSP) central receiver plant. Design and operations decisions addressed by this tool include: (i) the location of each heliostat in the solar field, and (ii) the intended aimpoint of each heliostat to the receiver for each hour, across a representative collection of days. Given weather and location data, heliostat specifications, a solar field layout, and a receiverâ€™s size, location, and geometry as input, HALOS outputs an aiming strategy that maximizes thermal power delivery to the receiver while ensuring that the thermal flux profile of the receiver falls within design specifications.  A key feature of the tool includes a method to subdivide the solar field into subfields, for which the aiming strategy can be optimized separately and in parallel.  This allows for aiming strategies to be obtainable using integer programming methods for commercial-scale plants within a matter of minutes.

The tool includes a module that directly interfaces with SolarPILOT, an NREL-developed solar field performance characterization tool, to obtain high-fidelity flux maps and solar field layouts.  HALOS also accepts flux images in flat-file format.

The software development is carried out at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/) and was previously funded by the U.S. Department of Energy under the award number DE-EE00035930.

## SolarPILOT Integration/Support
SolarPILOT is a design and optimization tool for concentrating solar power (CSP) central receiver plant developed by NREL and is available open source. HALOS provides access to SolarPILOT through python API and SolarPILOT can be used to populate flux/field into HALOS optimization model.
* The [SolarPILOT Python API](https://github.com/NREL/SolarPILOT/tree/copilot/deploy/api) is currently available within the [copilot](https://github.com/NREL/SolarPILOT/tree/copilot) branch of [SolarPILOT](https://github.com/NREL/SolarPILOT). 
* To integrate SolarPILOT into HALOS, [solarpilot.dll](https://github.com/NREL/SolarPILOT/blob/copilot/deploy/api/solarpilot.dll) and [copylot.py](https://github.com/NREL/SolarPILOT/blob/copilot/deploy/api/copylot.py) have to be in the HALOS directory at  ".\HALOS\code".  Within HALOS, [sp_module.py](https://github.com/NREL/HALOS/blob/master/code/sp_module.py) can be used to interact with SolarPilot.
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or above is required for SolarPILOT API to work. 

## Solver Binary Setup
HALOS is implmemented in Python 3.7 and uses Pyomo, an algebraic modeling language implemented in Python for its optimization model.  While a large collection of solvers are accessible to Pyomo, the default solver used in HALOS is Cbc.  The following steps will allow Cbc to be accessible within HALOS on Windows systems:
* Download the Cbc binary from its [location at COIN-OR](https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Cbc/).
* Add the folder location of the binary to the PATH environment variable
After adding this folder, placing binaries of other solvers that work with Pyomo in the same folder should allow Pyomo models to access them.  HALOS includes some settings for Cbc, GLPK, and CPLEX in the source code.  

## Running Case Studies 

Once SolarPILOT is setup to work, follow the following steps to run different cases.
1. Create CSV files for inputs 
    * Create a main CSV file that has the links to specific CSV input files, here's an [Example](https://github.com/NREL/HALOS/blob/master/case_inputs/radial_50_ca_case.csv). 
    * Now create CSV files for receiver, settings and provide the path to weather file and field file (if using existing field). 
    * Examples: [Receiver input CSV](https://github.com/NREL/HALOS/blob/master/case_inputs/radial_dagget_50/extcyl_50MW.csv), [Settings](https://github.com/NREL/HALOS/blob/master/case_inputs/radial_dagget_50/case_settings.csv)
2. If running for single hour with DNI provided in receiver file, run [main.py](https://github.com/NREL/HALOS/blob/master/code/main.py). For annual simulation of aimpoint strategy use [ao_annual_case_study.py](https://github.com/NREL/HALOS/blob/master/code/ao_annual_case_study.py). 
3. Follow step 2 for running HALOS only, SolarPILOT only or both. 
4. [sp_module.py](https://github.com/NREL/HALOS/blob/master/code/sp_module.py) can be used to obtain flux maps and field from SolarPILOT using the Python API.
